# DHOBI Management System

## Overview

The DHOBI Management System is a web application designed to streamline the process of managing laundry services. It helps users (students) easily create and manage their laundry orders, track costs, and pay using their college ID barcodes. It also addresses common challenges such as damage reporting, clothing tracking, and simplifying the payment process.

## Features

- **User Management**: Users can sign in and place orders for laundry services.
- **Order Creation**: Users can create orders by entering the items they want to launder, with automatic cost calculations.
- **Laundry Tracking**: Users can track the status of their laundry order (pending, completed).
- **Payment Integration**: Users can load money onto their college ID cards and use it for payments.
- **Digital Closet**: Users can track their laundry items and set reminders for regular laundry tasks.
- **QR/Barcode Labeling**: Use QR codes or barcodes for faster laundry check-in and tracking.
- **Damage Reporting**: Users can report damage or missing items with photos.
- **Lost & Found**: A system for identifying and recovering lost laundry items.
- **Budget Management**: Users can set a laundry budget and receive notifications when they are near the limit.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **React.js** for building the user interface
- **Axios** for making HTTP requests
- **HTML/CSS** for basic styling and structure
- **Bootstrap** for responsive UI components

### Backend
- **Node.js** for the backend server
- **Express.js** for routing
- **MongoDB** for database management
- **Mongoose** for schema validation and MongoDB integration

### Payment System
- **Barcode/QR Code Integration**: Using the college ID barcode for payment tracking.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure that you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (Download from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/))
- **MongoDB** (Download and install from [https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community))

### Step 1: Clone the repository

Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dhobi-management-system.git
cd dhobi-management-system
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

1. **Backend**:
   Navigate to the `backend` directory and install the necessary packages:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

2. **Frontend**:
   Navigate to the `frontend` directory and install the necessary packages:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

### Step 3: Set up MongoDB

Make sure **MongoDB** is installed and running on your machine. You can start MongoDB by running:

```bash
mongod
```

Verify MongoDB is running by checking the logs in your terminal.

### Step 4: Configure Backend

Ensure that your **backend server** (`server.js`) is set up to connect to your MongoDB database. Update the MongoDB connection URL if necessary:

```javascript
mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/dhobiDB', {
  useNewUrlParser: true,
  useUnifiedTopology: true,
});
```

### Step 5: Run the Project

1. **Start the Backend Server**:

   In the `backend` folder, run:

   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

   The backend server should now be running on `http://localhost:5000`.

2. **Start the Frontend Server**:

   In the `frontend` folder, run:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The frontend should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

### Step 6: Test the Application

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. You should be able to:
- Create orders for laundry services.
- Track the status of laundry items.
- Use the payment system with college ID barcodes.
- Report damage and track lost items.

## Notes

- This is a **testing environment**, so payment and other collections are simulated and will not be processed.
- The project is designed to be **scalable** and can be further enhanced with real payment integrations, authentication, and more advanced features.
